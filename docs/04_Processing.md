# Processing

## Processing infrastructure
Resources currently [here](computing.md#Computing-Resources).

## Preprocessing data
Processing has several stages, and can vary depending on which image modality (or type of data in general) you want to use.

If you are interested in processing a specific type of data, you can refer to the links below.

## Single-modality Processing
### MRI
Resources currently [here](analysis_software_MRI.md#Neuroimaging-analysis-software-for-MRI)
#### structural
* T1w
* T2w
* DTI
* Laminar and high-resolution MRI

#### functional MRI
* resting state fMRI
* task-related fMRI
### EEG
### MEG
Resources currently [here](analysis_software_MEEG.md#Neuroimaging-analysis-software-for-MEEG).

## Multi-modal Processing
Some processing pipelines require multiple types of data. Pipelines requiring multimodal data can be found [here].
